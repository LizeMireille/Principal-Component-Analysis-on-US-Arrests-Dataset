# Principal-Component-Analysis-on-US-Arrests-Dataset
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the US Arrests dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques. The dataset consists of statistics on arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973, along with the percentage of the population living in urban areas.

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive exploration of the US Arrests dataset using Python's data manipulation, analysis, and visualization libraries. 
The goal is to gain insights into crime statistics and urbanization levels, leading to a better understanding of state-level variations.

## How to Explore
1. Clone the repository to your local machine with Python and required libraries.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file "US_Arrests_PCA.ipynb"
3. Run the code cells in the Jupyter Notebook file to generate visualizations and perform analyses.
4. Review the insights and findings in the Jupyter Notebook file.
